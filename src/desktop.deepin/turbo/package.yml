    deepin-trubo is a deepin project that derives from Applauncherd.
    Applauncherd is a daemon that helps to launch applications faster by preloading dynamically linked libraries and caching stuff. It also saves memory, because all launched applications share certain resources.
    we built a booster type called dtkwidget-booster in this project to support launching dtk-based Apps faster.
